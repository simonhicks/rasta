EDIT: This has been abandoned... running an interpretter in ruby is mind-bogglingly slow. I'm now working on Nem which is the same kind of idea, except instead of running in an interpreter, it compiles to javascript. Check it out... it's going to be pretty cool!


A homoiconic dialect of ruby that tries to extend Ruby's incredible runtime flexibility to the abstract syntax tree, so you can change the syntax of the language while your code is running :). You could <i>almost</i> call rasta a lisp, except... you know... lisp's aren't 'cool'...

Although it kind of works, it should still be considered pre-pre-alpha and certainly isn't ready to be used for anything you're ever going to use.
